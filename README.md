Exercise to practice algorithm for draw 2D polygons in three programming language making each step in each language.
Get some fun with this big programming interest while the holiday isn't end yet, I need program. 
## Algorithm used for draw text 2D polygons in the screen
# 1) Define function to draw linear functions
# 2) Get 3 or more edges for 2D polygon lines with data validation
# 3) Draw 2D polygon Up line
# 4) Change line direction to make polygon shape
# 5) Draw line in the next position with new inclination
# 6) Draw line with opposite inclination in next position
# 7) Repeat (edges - 3) times steps 5 and 6 with other positions until close the shape
# 8) Draw base
